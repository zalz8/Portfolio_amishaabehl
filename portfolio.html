      <h4>UX Researcher </h4>
      <p>In 2022, I had the opportunity to work with the Reserve Bank of India as a UX researcher. During my time there, I was tasked with working on a project that involved conducting a comparative analysis of India's leading mobile banking apps. This project was particularly interesting, as it involved examining the user experience of each app and identifying areas for improvement. Through this project, I was able to gain valuable insights into the needs and preferences of mobile banking users in India, and provide recommendations to help improve the overall user experience of these apps. Working with the Reserve Bank of India was a great experience, and I am proud to have been a part of such an important project.</p>

  <div class="w3-container">
    <p>Recently, I had the opportunity to design a website about skincare using HTML and CSS. The website was designed to showcase various skincare products, as well as provide information on skincare routines and tips. To ensure that the website met the needs of users, I utilized Figma to create wireframe prototypes. This allowed me to visualize and test different design ideas before implementing them in HTML and CSS. I also incorporated responsive design principles to ensure that the website was optimized for various screen sizes, including desktop and mobile devices. By utilizing my skills in HTML, CSS, and Figma, I was able to create a user-friendly and visually appealing website that provided valuable information to users interested in skincare. Overall, the project was a great learning experience and allowed me to further develop my skills in web design and development..</p>

  <div class="w3-container">
    <p>I recently created a game using Scratch, a programming language designed for children to learn coding concepts. The game, titled "Anna's Balloon Adventure," features a main character named Anna who can be moved up and down using the arrow keys. The player must use the spacebar to shoot balloons from Anna's hands, with the goal of popping all the balloons before the time runs out. The game incorporates fun visuals, including colorful balloons and cute sound effects, making it engaging for players of all ages. By using Scratch, I was able to learn coding concepts while also exercising my creativity and imagination. Overall, creating "Anna's Balloon Adventure" was a fun and rewarding experience that allowed me to develop my skills as a game developer..</p>
